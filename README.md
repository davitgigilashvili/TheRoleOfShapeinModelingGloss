# TheRoleOfShapeinModelingGloss
The dataset of the images used in the article: The Role of Shape in Modeling Gloss by Davit Gigilashvili and Akib Jayed Islam

The copyright on these images is owned by the authors Davit Gigilashvili and Akib Jayed Islam. 
You can feel free to use them for your research purposes as long as a proper refernece and acknowledgement is included.

The file names include the information about the material properties that have been used for rendering them. 

The files are named in **X_ASD_X_X_X.png** format, where
the first letter means the *shape*: *S* for *sphere*, *L* for *Lucy*. 
And the three numbers after ASD mean *alpha*, *specular reflectance*, and *diffuse reflectance* components of the Ward's model, respectively. 

For example: if a file is called **L_ASD_0.07_0.099_0.03.png**, this means that it is a *Lucy* shape, with *alpha=0.07*; *specular reflectance=0.099*; and *diffuse reflectance=0.03*.
